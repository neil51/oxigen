Hello dear reader. You might have found this webpage through one of several platforms that we are running our campaign on. To begin, here is some information about us that might be important for you to know:

I am Neil Mathias. I am a third year engineering student. I live in a town close to Mangalore, Karnataka. I study in National Institute of Technology Tiruchirappalli. Alongside me, importantly notwithstanding virtually, is Navneeth Rajiv, who is my colleague from Ernakulam, Kerala. 

We want to (first) prototype and (later) manufacture in large numbers, portable oxygen concentrators to administer medical oxygen to patients suffering from decreased lung capacity due to coronavirus infection. 

For this, we will (urgently) require around 1 Lakh Rupees in funds, by the latest. The technical specifications for the components used are given in this doc. 

These funds will be used to procure the raw materials necessary to make a prototype oxygen concentrator, titled Oxigen 1.0. We will also require certain equipment to ensure the output of our device is medically-safe and is suitable for use in hospitals. 

You can find our campaign on [Milaap](https://milaap.org/fundraisers/support-neil-6). 

A complete explanation of each Rupee of crowd-fund spent on this project will be an inefficient use of our time as we are a short-staffed team with geographical restrictions. But do not be mistaken, your money will be spent ONLY for the purpose of immediate prototyping and manufacturing of Oxigen devices. 

To summarize, we are students from NIT Tiruchirappalli who want to produce in large numbers, oxygen concentrators for medical usage. 

### An important note to all those who have already donated or are in the process of donating to our campaign: 
We will not be able to repay the monetary contributions that you have made towards this project. But by donating, you are making a deal that promises some sort of repayment in the future, once the situation looks nothing like it is on this day. Thank you for considering to donate to our project.

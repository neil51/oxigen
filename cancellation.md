introduction: |
 We will try our best to utilize the funds raised through all mediums solely for the research and development of low-cost oxygen concentrator devices. In case we fail in making a fully-functional prototype, and decide to abandon the project, we will pay back in full the donations made by our kind donors.  

 The refund will be made on discussion via email or Whatsapp, and in the same medium as the payment was made, or through a similar medium.
